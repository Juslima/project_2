The ETL mini project focuses on building an ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas, and Python dictionary methods or regular expressions. It involves extracting data, transforming it, creating four CSV files, creating an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD), and a table schema. The data is then uploaded into a Postgres database, enabling querying and analysis using SQL. The project provides hands-on experience in building an ETL pipeline, ensuring data accessibility and integration.
